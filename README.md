# HLA whole gene sequence comparison pipeline

The pipeline compares the full length HLA gene sequences between donor and recipient and outputs the mimatched positions, functional annotations.

The pipeline has passed the Alpha test and analyzed 6,000 pairs of donor-recipient pairs' HLA gene sequences at five loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1).

Code improvement and Beta test in under way. The final version is set to release in June 2018.
